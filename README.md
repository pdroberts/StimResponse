# StimResponse
Tools for analyzing spike response data acquired with BatLab and Sparkle for auditory electrophysiology research

Contains 3 ipython notebooks to demonstrate the software.

`spikeAnalysis.ipynb` for analyzing spike responses to auditory stimuli. In particular, these methods apply a Bayesian approach to estimate the probability of a significant response to complex stimuli such as natural vocalizations. 

`CochleaDistortionModel.ipynb` for calculating the effective auditory stimuli following non-linear effects caused by transduction in the cochlea.

`DCN_Pharm_Analysis.ipynb` for analyzing spike response changes caused by pharmacological treatments in vivo.
